## üåê Key Projects

- **Advanced Network Scanner Using Nmap**  
  The advanced network scanner will utilize the Nmap scripting engine. The project will leverage the powerful capabilities of Nmap and its extensive library of scripts to perform comprehensive network scans and assessments. It will support various scanning techniques, including host discovery, port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection. 

  The scanner will utilize custom or pre-existing Nmap scripts to automate complex tasks and gather detailed information about networked devices and services. This project aims to provide users with an advanced and customizable network scanning solution, enabling in-depth network analysis and enhancing overall security posture.

- **Advanced Network Packet Capturing Tool**  
  The tool will enable the capture and analysis of network packets to gain insights into network traffic and diagnose network-related issues. It will provide features such as real-time packet capturing, filtering, and detailed packet analysis. 

  The tool will support various protocols and offer advanced filtering options to focus on specific network traffic of interest. Additionally, it will provide visualization capabilities and export options for further analysis. The project aims to provide network administrators and analysts with a robust and feature-rich tool to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize network performance. 

  Instead of reinventing the wheel and writing everything from scratch, libraries and frameworks in different programming languages can be used to develop a customized packet-capturing tool.

- **Exploit Development: Metasploit**
  The project focuses on providing methods and features for automating the exploit development using the functions and tools available in the popular Metasploit framework. Metasploit is a powerful and widely used penetration testing tool that identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in target systems. 

  The project will involve learning and utilizing the Metasploit framework to develop custom exploits, payloads, and modules. It will explore techniques such as remote code execution, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation activities. 

  The goal is to enhance understanding and proficiency in exploit development, enabling security professionals to effectively assess and strengthen the security of target systems, networks, and applications.
- **Packet Sniffing**
  Security specialists in the industry frequently employ this technique to keep tabs on how data is transmitted across their network. Typically, a packet comprises the information or data that is to be transported between two network sites, from the sender to the intended recipient. 

  This technique allows us to track and monitor the transmission of data packets from the source to the destination. You can do an outstanding final year thesis if you will consider this project, Network security projects primarily deal with network‚Äôs intrusion detection, monitoring illegal access and modification.

  When working with this cybersecurity project, you can either use Python scripts to follow the information in each packet or focus on its source and destination. Additionally, you can set up a system to trace any unauthorized access to critical information or ensure that the network infrastructure surrounding this packet transmission is protected from external incursions.
- **Wazuh Open Source SIEM**
  Wazuh is nowadays popularly used by businesses as SIEM solution in their Security operation center. It is completely packed with threat detection, integrity monitoring, and incident management features. Wazuh collects, aggregates, indexes, and evaluates security data, enabling enterprises to identify malicious risks and potential behavioral anomalies. Among its many features are the following: 

  Intrusion Discovery 
  Log Data Analysis 
  File Integrity Observation
  Vulnerability Discovery
  Wazuh is an open-source solution, so its full access is available free of cost without any requirement of licenses, along with an amazing supportive community. Those who are interested in defensive security should implement Wazuh in their lab environment and experience its usage, which will surely distinguish their resume from that of others in defensive security.
- **Wazuh Open Source SIEM**
  This can also be one of the great and unique cybersecurity thesis topics if you want to stand out in the competition. Extremely dynamic cloud applications necessitate an automated DevSecOps approach to security. Organizations must establish IaaS and PaaS-wide standard controls and allow automatic evaluation and repair.
